<h1>Modified Standalone Zombie System [Synchronized]</h1>

This is a modification of the Synchronized Standalone Zombie System by WeponzTV. This variation will have many changes over time, and there is no guarantee of function, but the idea is for a different kind of server.

Thanks to WeponzTV for the variation I'm working with here, and
Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Dislaik">Dislaik</a> for the base code.
